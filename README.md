## A NoSql Social Network API Backend

For this assignment we are to create the backend database that would could be used by a social network app. We are using Mongoose to connect MongoDB to Node.js. 

Currently, my app is not fully functioning. However, I am time constrained and the bug might be small or might be big. I will continue to debug. But, if not, I'm interested to see what grade I would get for what I have done so far.
